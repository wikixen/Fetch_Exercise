# NOTE
If you try to run this, it will fail as I've hidden the URL in my *local.properties* (I assumed Fetch would want to keep that info hidden and not have their servers blasted by random API calls if someone else found the code). 
In order to run on your setup, change the BASE_URL variable in the *app/src/main/java/com/benny/fetch_exercise/data/remote/RetrofitClient.kt* file with the actual URL.
